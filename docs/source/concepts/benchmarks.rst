Public benchmarks
=================

.. warning::
   This section is under a work in progress. We are constantly working on fine-tuning
   our experiments to enable our users to have access to state-of-the-art benchmarks.
   If you would like to collaborate in this effort, please reach out to us.

In the `fine_tuned <https://github.com/facebookresearch/BenchMARL/tree/main/fine_tuned>`__
folder we are collecting some tested hyperparameters for
specific environments to enable users to bootstrap their benchmarking.
You can just run the scripts in this folder to automatically use the proposed hyperparameters.

We will tune benchmarks for you and publish the config and benchmarking plots on
:wandb:`null` `Wandb <https://wandb.ai/matteobettini/benchmarl-public/reportlist>`__ publicly.

Currently available ones are:
