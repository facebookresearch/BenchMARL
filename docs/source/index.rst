**BenchMARL** is a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) training library created to enable reproducibility
and benchmarking across different MARL algorithms and environments.
Its mission is to present a standardized interface that allows easy integration of new algorithms and environments to
provide a fair comparison with existing solutions.
BenchMARL uses :torchrl:`null` `TorchRL <https://github.com/pytorch/rl>`__ and :pytorch:`null` `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org>`__
as its backend, which grants it high performance
and state-of-the-art implementations.
It also uses `hydra <https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/>`__ for flexible and modular configuration,
and its data reporting is compatible with `marl-eval <https://sites.google.com/view/marl-standard-protocol/home>`__
for standardised and statistically strong evaluations.

BenchMARL **core design tenets** are:

* *Reproducibility through systematical grounding and standardization of configuration*
* *Standardised and statistically-strong plotting and reporting*
* *Experiments that are independent of the algorithm, environment, and model choices*
* *Breadth over the MARL ecosystem*
* *Easy implementation of new algorithms, environments, and models*
* *Leveraging the know-how and infrastructure of TorchRL without reinventing the wheel*

Why would I BenchMARL ðŸ¤”?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Why would you BenchMARL, I see you ask.
Well, you can BenchMARL to compare different algorithms, environments, models,
to check how your new research compares to existing ones, or if you just want to approach
the domain and want to easily take a picture of the landscape.
