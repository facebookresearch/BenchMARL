Notebooks
=========

In the following you can find a list of  :colab:`null` Google Colab notebooks to help you learn how to use BenchMARL:

- :colab:`null` `Running BenchMARL experiments <https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/BenchMARL/blob/main/notebooks/run.ipynb>`_
- :colab:`null` `Creating a VMAS scenario and training it in BenchMARL <https://colab.research.google.com/github/proroklab/VectorizedMultiAgentSimulator/blob/main/notebooks/Simulation_and_training_in_VMAS_and_BenchMARL.ipynb>`_. We will create a scenario where multiple robots with different embodiments need to navigate to their goals while avoiding each other (as well as obstacles) and train it using MAPPO and MLP/GNN policies.
